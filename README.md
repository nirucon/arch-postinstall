# arch-postinstall
A post-install script for Arch Linux, tailored to my specific needs. It includes system optimizations, the installation of suckless software like DWM (with custom colors), a selection of various applications focused on music, image, and media creation, and various other scripts. It is freely available for use and modify, but I disclaim all forms of liability. Use the script at your own risk.
